Reflection 1		{#one}
====================================
Today we sold out Jr Chicken very soon but the problem is that we couldn't sell Apple Pie and Coke.
I think we don't need to sell Apple Pie anymore and buy more Jr Chicken, that worth some investment.

Reflection 2        {#two}
====
Today we sold Jr Chicken pretty soon too and we bought 10 more Jr Chicken and we don't sell Apple Pie anymore because nobody wants to buy Apple Pie.
Jr Chicken is still the most demanding product so I think we need to focus on Jr Chicken so abandon Coke tomorrow.

Reflection 3        {#three}
=====
We bought 45 Jr Chicken today and we sold out quick too but the money we spend is out of the expectation.
